<h3>Last post for the year!</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>
  I've been fleshing out more of the PyBlosxom Manual to give Ted more
  material for a possible PyCon 2005 talk and also to fill in documentation
  gaps which will make a PyBlosxom 1.1 release easier for people.
</p>
<p>
  I encourage folks to skim the manual as it is thus far.  I'm still
  doing some minor organizational changes, but for the most part what's
  there will form the basis of the continuing manual saga.  If you have
  comments, complaints, interesting stories, or even additional manual
  material, toss it in the comments at the bottom of the relevant chapter.
</p>
<p>
  Rock on!

<h3>More changes</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>
  More changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>added some more chapters to the pyblosxom manual covering topics like
      flavours and templates, plugins, and static rendering
  <li>added a "printer-friendly" link to the manual pages
  <li>fixed some bugs in some of the plugins that this site uses
  <li>went through and made sure the site validates as HTML 4.01 transitional
      (which caused me to discover some issues here and there with the HTML)
  <li>added a colophon
</ul>
<p>
  Ben asked on the pyblosxom-users list whether there's anything other
  folks can do to help with this site.  The answer is yes, but it's nothing
  that's wildly exciting or glamorous.
</p>
<p>
  It would help if people could review the content in the manual.  There
  are a couple of ways you could send fixes, adjustments, and your thoughts
  on the content.  The first is to post a comment at the bottom of the
  chatper in question.  The second is to send an email to willhelm at
  users dot sourceforge dot net.  The third is to send an email to
  the pyblosxom-users mailing list.  Try to be as clear as you can
  about what you're trying to say.  Feel free to quote the sections
  you have issues with.  I'll incorproate any comments, thoughts, and
  additional content into the manual as I get them.  I'll create
  a contributors section on the content page with a list of contributors.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, people are looking for flavours so if you have any to
  register, please do.
</p>
<p>
  I think that's about it.  We're still moving along at a steady clip.
  Assuming we can maintain this clip, we should have a solid PyBlosxom
  manual in a month or so--that's a huge step in making PyBlosxom more
  user-friendly for all of us.

<h3>New site!</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>
  Seems a little silly to have yet-another-pyblosxom site, but here's the
  thinking: we need a site that supports users, supports developers,
  has a manual, and centralizes flavours and plugins and stuff.  We're
  putting it on SourceForge with the rest of the project stuff.  We couldn't
  put it here until a week ago because their servers didn't have a version
  of Python installed that could run PyBlosxom.  But it does now, so
  everything's cool again.
</p>
<p>
  So far I have the following things working on this site:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>news entries
  <li>plugin registry
  <li>flavour registry
  <li>registry submissions
  <li>comments with secret number comment-spam prevention
  <li>rss for news and rss for registry
  <li>the start of a pyblosxom manual
</ul>
<p>
  Still to do:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>need a way to administrate comments (web-form?)
  <li>need to implement bloggar entry creation
  <li>continue working on pyblosxom manual
  <li>need to add comment preview (use Steven's version?)
  <li>need to add a link for archives
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, though, things are looking good.  Hopefully it shouldn't take too
  long to put the rest of the critical pieces together.
