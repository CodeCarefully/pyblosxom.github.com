<h1>PyBlosxom in Google Summer of Code 2007</h1>
<div class="news">
<div class="content">
<!-- PAGES PAGE START -->

<p>
  PyBlosxom is a file-based weblog system that is written in Python,
  extended in Python (through plugins), and has CGI and WSGI interfaces
  allowing it to run in a variety of environments.  PyBlosxom is used
  by an interesting group of people many of whom chose PyBlosxom because
  it was written in Python and they can bend it to meet their needs
  which are very wide-ranging.
</p>
<p>
  Blake poked me (Will) and suggested I offer to mentor PyBlosxom projects
  which I think is a really great idea.  I went through the big TODO
  list (which is less of a TODO list and more of an ideas of things that
  should be looked into to see if they're interesting to do) and came
  up with the projects that follow.  (I'm modelling this after the DrProject
  <a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/wiki/DrProjectSoC2007">SoC2007 
  page</a>.)  This list isn't in any particular order--certainly not 
  interestingness or priority.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Project 1:</b>
</p>
<p>
  Examine the current state of storage for PyBlosxom and the methods of
  access (mainly tools.Walk), evaluate the requirements, and write a
  better API for storing and accessing entry (and other?) data.
</p>
<p>
  Things to keep in mind about the end result:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>it should work in Python 2.2 through 2.5
  <li>it should allow for caching on a blog level (we have caching at
      an entry level right now)
  <li>it needs to allow for concurrent PyBlosxom requests
  <li>allowing for different storage mediums (SVN, MySQL, ...) should
      be kept in mind as well
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Mentors:</b> Blake, Will
</p>

<p>
  <b>Project 2:</b>
</p>
<p>
  PyBlosxom is still tied to its single-user roots and while there are
  a bunch of different ways to hack PyBlosxom to a multi-user blog 
  system, there's currently no official/easy way to set this up.
  This project would involve figuring out what the requirements need
  to be, designing a solution, and implementing it.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Mentors:</b> Blake, Will
</p>

<p>
  <b>Project 3:</b>
</p>
<p>
  This project is to build a web-based front end for blogging in PyBlosxom.
  PyBlosxom is a file-system based weblog so most people log into their
  servers and edit their entries with their favorite text editor (or
  some variation on that theme).  Some users are looking to setup PyBlosxom
  instances for relatives and friends who or they're looking for an easier
  interface themselves.
</p>
<p>
  There are a bunch of decisions that need to be made regarding this.
  Should it go through xmlrpc metaweblog/bloggar to access the entries?
  Should it access entries directly?  Should it support plugins adding
  functionality to it?  Should it run as a PyBlosxom handler or should
  it be separate?  ...
