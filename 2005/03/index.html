<h3>Site updates and PyBlosxom's future plans</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>
  I did a quick update to the links on the menu bar of the web-site (you 
  can see the menu bar to the left there).  We need to maintain separate 
  versions of the documentation for prior versions of PyBlosxom and it was
  getting messy so I moved all documentation links to the new 
  <a href="/blog/static/documentation.html">documentation page</a>.
  Hopefully it's clear enough for new users and old users alike.
</p>
<p>
  The list of things we've been thinking about doing for PyBlosxom is 
  really long and contains items that have been fleshed out as well as 
  items that haven't been fleshed out at all and are currently just 
  looking for someone to do some more analysis.  I'm going to take my 
  notes and dump a bunch of "feature requests" in the feature tracker 
  on the SourceForge section.  The trackers are mildly crappy, but it's 
  better than spending the time right now to build something on our own.
</p>
<p>
  The plan right now is to let PyBlosxom 1.2 simmer a bit and shake out 
  some of the issues it might have.  Additionally, I'm going to try to 
  spend some more time on fleshing out the manual and fixing up the 
  contributed plugins that I either wrote or had a hand in writing.
</p>
<p>
  We've got some ideas about what the next version will entail, but
  nothing is set in stone.  It's likely we'll know more in a month.
</p>
<p>
  And lastly, Planet PyBlosxom is no more.  I had the domain name for
  a year and ran the site, but then decided I didn't want to run it
  any more.  At some point, I'll set up something on here, but it's
  low-ish on my todo list at the moment.
</p>
<p>
  I think that about covers it for this status update.

<h3>Contributed plugins 1.2 released</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>
  This contributed plugins pack contains a bunch of plugins and scripts 
  that should work with PyBlosxom 1.2.  Use these plugins at your own 
  risk.
</p>
<p>
  Each plugin should have documentation at the top of the plugin file. 
  Read that for installation instructions.  If you find any bugs or have 
  any problems, contact us at pyblosxom-devel@lists.sourceforge.net .
</p>
<p>
  Download it <a

<h3>Contributed plugins 1.1.1 released</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>
  This is a followup for the contrib 1.1 release.  These plugins 
  should work with PyBlosxom 1.1.
</p>
<p>
  Use these plugins at your own risk.  Each plugin should have 
  documentation at the top of the plugin file.  Read that for installation 
  instructions.
</p>
<p>
  If you find any bugs or have any problems, contact us at 
  pyblosxom-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
</p>
<p>
  The only difference between 1.1 and 1.1.1 is that I removed the
  bad block of code in the comments plugin.  If you are using PyBlosxom
  1.1 and either have the comments plugin working fine or you're not
  using it at all, then don't worry about this release.

<h3>PyBlosxom 1.2 released</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>
  <b>Pertinent to users:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We added a "blog_email" item to config.py and changed "blog_author"
    to just the author's name.  Examples:</p>
<pre>
   py["blog_email"] = "joe@blah.com"
   py["blog_author"] = "Joe Man"
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>We no longer adjust blog_title from what you set in config.py.  Now
   we have a "blog_title_with_path" variable which is in the data dict
   which is the blog_title with the path information.  People who want
   the title of their blog to be the title and not include the path
   should use $blog_title.  Folks who want the old behavior where the
   path was appended to the title should use $blog_title_with_path .</p>
</li>
<li><p>We now support WSGI, mod_python, and Twisted in addition to CGI.</p></li>
<li><p>Upped our Python requirement to Python 2.2.  If you have an earlier
   version than that, you won't be able to use PyBlosxom 1.2.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Changed "defaultFlavour" to "default_flavour".  This property allows
   you to specify the flavour to use by default if the URI doesn't
   specify one.  It default to "html".</p>
</li>
<li><p>We moved the main PyBlosxom site to http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/ .
   There's a "powered by pyblosxom" image at:</p>
<p>
      http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/images/pb_pyblosxom.gif
</p>
<p>
   You should adjust your templates accordingly.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Pertinent to developers and plugin developers:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We now have a Request and a Response object.  See API documentation
   for more details.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't use os.environ directly--use the http dict.  For example, this
   is bad:</p>
<pre>
   path_info = os.environ["HTTP_PATHINFO"]
</pre>
<p>
   This is what you should be doing:
</p>
<pre>
   http = request.getHttp()
   path_info = http["HTTP_PATHINFO"]
</pre>
<p>
   If you use os.environ directly, it's likely your plugin won't work
   with non-CGI installations of PyBlosxom.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>We added __iter__, read, readline, readlines, seek, and tell
   to the Request object.  All of them access the input stream.
   You should not use sys.stdin directly.</p>
<p>
   Usage:
</p>
<pre>
   data = request.read()
   data_part = request.read(1024)
   one_line = request.readline()
   lines = request.readlines()
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>The output stream should be accessed through the PyBlosxom Response
   object.  The following methods are implemented in the Response
   object: __iter__, close, flush, read, readline, readlines,
   seek, tell, write, writelines, setStatus, and addHeader.
   You should not use sys.stdout directly. See the API for more details.
</p>
<p>
   Usage:
</p>
<pre>
   response = request.getResponse()
   response.addHeader('Status', '200 Ok')
   response.addHeader('Content-type', 'text/html')
   response.write("Hello World")
   response.writelines(["list", "of", "data"])
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Instead of doing:</p>
<pre>
   form = request.getHttp()["form"]
</pre>
<p>
   you can now do:
</p>
<pre>
   form = request.getForm()
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Plugins should not be importing the config module and looking at the
   py dict directly.  You should instead use the Request
   getConfiguration() method to get the config py dict.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Also, we have a new manual.  I converted the manual I was writing in
  HTML over to docbook, made a lot of changes, and added a lot more content
  covering installation, configuration, flavours, and plugins.  We're
  still missing content on developing plugins and PyBlosxom's architecture.
  That will come with future versions of the manual.
</p>
<p>
  The new PyBlosxom manual can be found 
  <a href="/1.2/manual/index.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you have problems, check out the new PyBlosxom Manual and if that doesn't
  help, send us questions on the pyblosxom-users mailing list.
