We now have a shiny new repo for themes - I've uploaded an updated version of MainlyGreen
to get started with, which has been updated for the latest PyBlosxom 
and optimized for pagnate and the comments plugin</p>

<p>
It's been almost a full year since my last news update. Hi!</p>
<p>It's been a pretty tumultuous year both for me and PyBlosxom. </p>

<p>I've spent a lot of this time getting used to the codebase,
which was frankly somewhat intimidating to someone new to the project,
which I was when I first joined a year ago.</p>

<p> On the Pyblosxom front,Although we haven't had a super-large amount of updates, 
We did get some bugs squashed and began a new repo for external plugins,
which I hope will eventually lead to plugins being more updated and accessable</p>

<p>Markus Koschany (https://launchpad.net/~apoleon) has been working on 
the Debian repo to finally get our package there updated for the next release. (Thank you!)</p>

<p>We made the move over to GitHub will all our stuff and the documentation has been updated to reflect it</p>

<p>I'm happy to note it looks like we got a few new installs and a few new faces appeared on IRC</p>

<p>I hope this year brings a lot more to the table for PyBlosxom and my door is 
always open for comments, criticism, suggestions or help :-)</p>

<p>
  -Akai

  After a significant number of years (since approx 2003) running PyBlosxom, willg has stepped down from managing the project and 
  passed it over to me, Akai.<br>
  will, thank you for your considerable effort in making PyBlosxom the program we know and love today.<br>
  <br>
  I'm available on the mailing lists and frequently on the IRC channel (as AkaiKitsune) for any question or issue I can help with.<br>
  Part of the handoff is the move from the bluesock.org domain to github for both the site and the repositories.<br>
  Update your bookmarks to http://pyblosxom.github.com/, that's our new home!
</p>

  We did 1.5 rc2 10 months ago.  Since then we've added a few new plugins,
  fixed a bunch of bugs, worked on making the documentation better, updated
  docstrings, and some other stuff.
</p>
<p>
  There are still a bunch of polish things that need to be done, so we're
  going to do another release candidate.
</p>
<p>
  Download the new version at 
  <a href="/download/pyblosxom-1.5rc3.tar.gz">pyblosxom-1.5rc3.tag.gz</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any problems, say hi on IRC (<code>#pyblosxom</code>
  on <code>irc.freenode.net</code>), send an email to the pyblosxom-users 
  mailing list, or send me an email at <code>willg at bluesock dot org</code>.

  We've done a ton of work over the last 3 and a half months.  One thing
  that I finally got around to was overhauling the web-site.  The new
  web-site is (I think) a lot better, more informative, and easier to
  use.
</p>
<p>
  Things that still need to be done:
</p>
<ol>
<li>update the plugin registry
<li>update the flavour registry
<li>compile the 1.5 documentation and push that to the site
</ol>
<p>
  There are still a series of outstanding tasks for PyBlosxom 1.5 that should
  get finished before we release 1.5 final.  We're working on them.  We
  could use your help!
</p>
<ul>
<li>check PyBlosxom 1.5 in git to see if it works with your blog and plugins
<li>run the unit tests
<li>edit and update documentation
<li>triage and fix bugs in the 1.5 milestone in the bug tracker
</ul>
<p>
  We just finished up a sprint week and we're eager to finish up 1.5 and
  get it out.  Hopefully, we'll get that done in the next week or two.
</p>

<p>
  Development slowed down during the second half of 2010 because I was
  bogged down with other things.  I recognize how that totally sucks
  for the project.  I'm working on rectifying it now.
</p>
<p>
  Previously, we were using the SF bug tracker which sucked.  Since
  we did much with it, it's undergone a user interface overhaul and it's
  better, but it's still missing features this project needs.  So we
  stopped using it and I directed people to file bug reports by sending
  email to the pyblosxom-devel mailing list.
</p>
<p>
  In October of 2010, we discussed issue trackers.  Then I went on
  hiatus for a little over a month.  I've returned now and set up Roundup
  to host PyBlosxom issues and feature requests.  With help from Asheesh
  and the awesome folks at <a href="http://openhatch.org">OpenHatch</a>
  I added support for tracking milestones.  I've moved all open bugs
  and features from the SF bug tracker to the new bug tracker.
</p>
<p>
  You can find it at <a href="http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/bugs/">http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/bugs/</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I also got through the queue of merge requests from Dieter.  I
  really apologize for sitting on those for so long.  I really appreciate
  the work he did on them.
</p>
<p>
  I want to move ahead and get a PyBlosxom 1.5 rc3 out soon.  We're still
  fixing problems in plugins and working on getting PyBlosxom and the core
  plugins to a stable state--hence the need for ongoing release candidates
  rather than a final release.
</p>
<p>
  I want to thank Dieter for his prodding.  Also, Tim, Marius, Bill, Michael,
  Glennie, Sean, Sebastian, and Asheesh for their participation, efforts, 
  thoughts, and other positive energy things on #miro-hackers and the
  pyblosxom-devel list.  I'm looking forward to the rest of 2011, cleaning
  up the project and making it better for everyone.

  It's been about 6 months since 1.5 rc1.  Since then we've been updating
  plugins, added some new plugins, adding tests, fixed documentation, 
  added a sortlist callback, updated docstrings, switched from subversion
  to git, moved from SourceForge to Bluesock, and some other stuff.
</p>
<p>
  Doing another release candidate because there's still a lot of work to
  do updating plugins, adding tests, and fixing documentation.

<p>
  We're moving from SourceForge to Bluesock.  Bluesock is my own personal
  server where I'll have a lot more control over the site in terms of how
  it's built.  On SourceForge we're severely limited to static pages or
  the various applications that they install.  It's been a real pain in
  the ass.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, I've gone through the site and updated it to reflect our
  move from svn to git.
</p>
<p>
  On top of that, we're ditching the SourceForge bug tracker.  We don't
  have a bug tracker set up, though, so we're just going to wing it with
  the pyblosxom-devel mailing list.  If it becomes necessary, we'll set
  up a new bug tracker.
</p>
<p>
  PyBlosxom 1.5 is almost done.  A handful of things have been done since
  the release candidate a while back.  The documentation still needs another
  going over and parts of it need to be updated.
</p>
<p>
  Hopefully all that will happen soon.
</p>

<p>
  There have been lots of changes in the last few months.  We're
  finishing up PyBlosxom 1.5 and we're moving the project to different
  infrastructure.  Let me cover these one at a time.
</p>
<p>
  We did a PyBlosxom 1.5 rc1 release a couple of months ago.  Since
  then, we've been hanging out on <code>#pyblosxom</code> on Freenode
  and fielding questions.  I think it's going really well for
  everyone.  As people bring up issues, we're fixing them or putting
  them on the TODO list to get fixed.  Most of the problems revolve
  around plugin support or plugin bugs.
</p>
<p>
  We've been working on updating plugins in the contributed plugins
  pack.  We're also getting rid of the contributed plugins pack and
  going back to what we used to do several versions ago where we ship
  plugins with the PyBlosxom tarball.  Plugins that are used by many
  users and are well supported will be located in
  the <code>plugins/</code> directory of the tarball.  We have a unit
  test system set up and we're adding tests for these plugins.  We'll
  be making an effort going forward to update plugins as we update
  PyBlosxom core and everything should be shiny happy.
</p>
<p>
  We're planning to rework the plugin registry on the site to provide
  an index of all the plugins out there--both those in the tarball and
  those maintained by other people.  Work on this hasn't started,
  yet.  I think this is a post PyBlosxom 1.5 project.
</p>
<p>
  There are a handful of plugins that I want to update, add tests for,
  and move to the <code>plugins/</code> directory to ship with the
  tarball.  Once that happens, we'll release a 1.5 final.
</p>
<p>
  In regards to the infrastructure, we're switching to git.  Sebastian
  very kindly converted our svn repository into three git repositories
  that are now at
  <a href="http://gitorious.org/pyblosxom/">http://gitorious.org/pyblosxom/</a>.
  This will make development a lot easier going forward.
</p>
<p>
  We're also scheming to rework the website so it's a better project
  website, has a better registry for plugins and flavours, and makes
  it easier for us to collaborate on PyBlosxom development.
</p>
<p>
  That's where we're at.  If you want to contribute and/or hang out,
  we're on <code>#pyblosxom</code> on Freenode and the PyBlosxom
  develop mailing list.
</p>

  It's been two years since the last release.  Since then the world has turned,
  tools have improved (thank you Sphinx!), and PyBlosxom has undergone a lot
  of changes.  The list of changes is really long.  As such, this is a release
  candidate to get some more testing.
